\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, our comprehensive validation of the wBMS system has encompassed diverse approaches. Additionally, various software tools, including version control through Git, minimalmodbus, and supplementary utilities, have played pivotal roles in expediting the development of diverse testing frameworks. The advantages of modularizing our test framework, as demonstrated, not only facilitate the process for developers but also enhance user experience in crafting robust frameworks. This modular approach serves as our guiding principle for extending similar strategies to other sensor families in future endeavours.


\section{Future work}

Our forthcoming objectives mainly revolve around extending the testing capabilities to be compatible with different sensor families and implementing analogous resilient frameworks. This approach will remain rooted in the core principles of modularity and user-friendliness, with a constant focus on enhancing the overall user experience.

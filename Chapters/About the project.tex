\section{Problem statement}
Use automation concepts to test the software present on the embedded devices of a wBMS system and deliver it to customers quickly and efficiently without bugs.

\section{Motive}
There is a growing demand for advanced cockpit electronic systems as a result of the automotive industry's ongoing shift towards electric mobility. These technologies are essential for enabling comprehensive vehicle component monitoring and for providing the occupants with a clear, comprehensive overview of the current state and overall health of the vehicle. \\
The battery of the car is by far the most important of the crucial factors that need constant monitoring. This is particularly important for battery packs made mostly of Li-ion substrates because of the potential for severe, potentially dangerous consequences if their health and charge states are not strictly monitored. \\
Given these factors, Analog Devices Inc. provides a wBMS solution that is simple to integrate into the automotive setting with certain OEMs.

\section{Main objectives}
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To identify the testcases to be executed on the software of the wBMS system
    \item To write scripts to perform manual testing of all the tests
    \item To automate the running of the test suite created and generation of a test report
\end{enumerate}

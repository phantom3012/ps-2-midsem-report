\lhead{Chapter 2. \emph{Methodology}}

\section{Solution Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ensure a method in place to send the software to the devices to be tested
    \item crete an interface that allows us to send and recieve data from the wireless network formed
    \item run the data through a created test framework
    \item analyse the data and generate a bug report to be used by the development team
\end{itemize}

\section{Architechture}
\subsection{Hardware architecture}
\subsection{Software architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minor description on the architecture of the wBMS with a diagram: Multiple gateways to multiple nodes
    \item insert reference to Jlinks
    \item Software architecture: Open source software used: Python/Pytest (insert refs to python/pytest docs)
\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow}
\subsection{Testing ideologies}
\subsection{Test execution with the framework}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the whole process of testing: planning, development, environment, execution (include all relevant refs)
    \item inlude the pytest ss in the test execution with the framework subsection
\end{itemize}

\section{Automation of the workflow}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain how testing manually for each test case even with the framework developed is hard to manage
    \item Jenkins: automate testing triggers (insert ref for jenkins)
\end{itemize}

\section{Initial testing methods}

The original execution of this procedure was conducted utilising the Python programming language, employing a hybrid methodology that integrates scripting techniques with the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Although this particular methodology has proven to be effective in achieving the intended outcomes, it has posed several difficulties in terms of sustainability and flexibility. As the system has undergone development, it has been evident that the introduction of new needs entails making many modifications dispersed throughout different files, resulting in a codebase that is more vulnerable to errors and less modular.

In response to the challenges identified, a decision has been made to pivot toward an alternative approach, more centred on OOP principles and modularity of the codebase.

\section{Current testing methods}

To further evaluate the functionalities of the sensors in a phased approach, we use certain APIs exposed by ADI's (internally developed) software. These APIs allow us to directly communicate with the wBMS system and monitor all important aspects of the system.

These API calls are bundled together across the codebase and exposed to users to be called easily, eliminating any faults that may be caused by the software's UI. This will also help the developers of the test frameworks to keep things modular and easy to maintain in the long run
